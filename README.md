📚 I'm also pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Western Governors University (WGU). My journey here has been a continuous exploration of the endless possibilities in the world of code.

💻 One of my recent accomplishments is creating a simple yet efficient printer script. This script automates the installation of printers, making life easier for users and reducing IT overhead. I love finding ways to streamline processes and make technology work seamlessly for everyone.
